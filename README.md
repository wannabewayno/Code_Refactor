# Code_Refactor

This repository contains modified source code for Horiseon's Website, a marketing agency. 

### Scope
The scope of the project was to refactor the original source code to make the website reach accessiblity standards and boost SEO 

Both the html and the CSS were modified to reach this target.

### Accessibility targets.

By modifying the source code, several key accessilbilty standards were acheived and outlined below

* #### Semantic HTML
    * Html `<div>` elements were replaced with appropriate tags to give the document a logical structure.
    * A more defined structure will allow screen readers to identify key areas of a website and provide a better interpretation of the content
    * Structure also represents a more content driven website further boosting search engine rankings
* #### Accessibilty 
    * The css file was modified heavily to remove superfluous tags and acheive a more effecient layout, increasing readability.
    * Further modifcation by semanticaly renaming classes that reflected the style of the HTML structure to further increase readability of the code. 
    * Additonal code was put in place to enhance the aesthetics of the site. This allowed the style of the website to be responsive independant of browser size, whilst still retaining the original design and feel of the source code.
    * All images were given appropriate and descriptive alt attributes
    * An Eric Meyers CSS reset was added to the repo for browser compatibility
* #### Company Marketing
    * Adding to the website, a more engaging title was used to set the site apart from it's competitors.
    * A title description was used to add context and draw in readers.
    * keyword meta tags were added to further boost search rankings.

### The final refactor

All refactored code can be found in this github repo,
